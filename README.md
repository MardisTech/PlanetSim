# planet_sim
2D Planetary Orbit Simulation using Newtonian Physics in python pygame. Uses the real values of mass, distance, velocity, time, and physical constants as described by the astrophysical literature. 

Includes the planets up to neptune, the farthest planet and the Sun.

Click on buttons to add a black hole, sun-like star, and/or Jupiter-like planet. The added objects enter at a straight vertical initial trajectory from the bottom of the window. The objects will interact with the other objects gravitationally, simulating a scenario of what would happen if a foreign object passed through our solar system.
